Similar to [nbviewer.org](https://nbviewer.org), we don't store any `.ipynb` notebook files. We just render notebooks to HTML from either URLs or uploads and then overlay a whiteboard on top. Also similar to nbviewer, this HTML is cached so that when collaborators join a whiteboard, the HTML is ready to be served to them without having to do the `.ipynb` to `.html` conversion again.

# Inviting others (free accounts)

Free accounts gain one private notebook per user that they invite to join JupyterSpot. To invite someone to join, visit the [account page](https://jupyterspot.com/account) after signing up and enter the email address of the person you wish to invite. They'll be sent an invite link to sign up, and once they've done so, you'll see your "Accepted Invites" count increment. This count is the number of private notebooks that you're allowed to create.

Once someone accepts an invite, you'll see a new section in the form to add a new notebook on the [notebooks page](https://jupyterspot.com/notebooks).

# Adding notebooks from Colab, SageMaker, etc

JupyterSpot supports any notebook in `.ipynb` format, which means that if you use another notebook service like Colab, SageMaker, Azure, DeepNote, or CoCalc, you can still export the notebook as an `.ipynb` file and use JupyterSpot with it.

## Colab

As an example, we can export [this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/juba/StableDiffusionNotebook/blob/main/Stable_Diffusion_custom_notebook.ipynb) to `.ipynb` by clicking `File -> Download -> Download .ipynb`

Once you've downloaded this file, you can either upload it to JupyterSpot as a private notebook (non-free accounts) or put it on GitHub and add via URL as a public notebook (free accounts).

## SageMaker, Azure, DeepNote, and CoCalc

The process is similar for SageMaker, Azure, DeepNote, or CoCalc. Simply export your notebook to `.ipynb` and then add it to JupyterSpot.

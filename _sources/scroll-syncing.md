# Scroll syncing

When someone presents a long Jupyter notebooks of their latest results remotely over Zoom, it becomes hard to ask a question about a specific figure without a lot of verbal interaction about where to scroll to. It's also impossible to go back and review something important in the initial notebook cells that the presenter has already scrolled past. JupyterSpot introduces the concept of a scroll leader and gives you the option to sync your scroll position with theirs.

## The scroll leader

When you add a notebook to JupyterSpot, you automatically become the scroll leader, meaning that the scroll positions of others viewers are synced to yours. This lets you scroll down as your present your work and have them automatically follow you. 

When you are the scroll leader, the right scroll syncing button will look like this:

Anyone can become the scroll leader and have all participants sync with their position. This is useful if someone has a question about a result that the presenter has already scrolled past. To take over scrolling so that you can ask the question, click the right scroll syncing button which will look like this:

## Following the scroll leader

Syncing your scroll position with the leader is enabled by default, however you can disable it using the left scroll syncing button. Initially, the button looks like this and indicates that your scroll position is synced to the leader:

If you wish to break away and scroll on your own, simply click the closed lock:

When you're ready to join back to the leader, you can click it again to start syncing your scroll position again. This feature is handy if you want to look back over the notebook while the presenter keeps going.

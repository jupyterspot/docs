# Adding users (pro accounts)

Pro accounts can add users via the [account page](https://jupyterspot.com/account) after logging in. To add a member of your organization to JupyterSpot, enter their email address to have an invite link sent to them. Once the user clicks the link to accept the invitation and signs up, you'll see a check mark in the accepted column under their email and you'll now be billed for that user at the end of the pay period.

To ensure a user is mapped to your organization, it's important that they click the invite link to sign up for JupyterSpot instead of visiting the site and signing up independently.

The "Users" row showing "0 / 10" indicates that you've used zero out of ten allocated user seats. To add a member of your organization to JupyterSpot, enter their email address and click "Send Invite". An email will be sent to them that looks something the following: -->

<!-- This user now counts towards one of your allocated user seats. To ensure a user is mapped to your organization, it's important that they click the invite link to sign up for JupyterSpot instead of visiting the site directly. -->

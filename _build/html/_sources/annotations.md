# Whiteboarding with your notebook

Talking about Jupyter data visualizations over Zoom can be difficult when you have no way of pointing directly to something on the screen. For example, it's often hard to verbally describe where on the plot an outlier is or where the seasonality is breaking down for a time-series.
## Tools

JupyterSpot gives you several tools for annotating your notebook that can help with this. All objects created by these tools sync in real-time so that you and your colleagues always see the same thing.

## Styles

The styles palette can be used to select options that apply to other tools, such as color, fill, texture, and size. It's accessible from the top right of your screen next to the undo and redo buttons and can be kept open by clicking "Keep Open".

# Adding users (paid accounts)

Paid accounts in the Team and Business tiers can add user seats via the [account page](https://jupyterspot.com/account) after logging in.

The "Users" row showing "0 / 10" indicates that you've used zero out of ten allocated user seats. To add a member of your organization to JupyterSpot, enter their email address and click "Send Invite". An email will be sent to them that looks something the following:

Once the user clicks the link to accept the invitation and signs up, you'll see a check mark in the accepted column:

This user now counts towards one of your allocated user seats. To ensure a user is mapped to your organization, it's important that they click the invite link to sign up for JupyterSpot instead of visiting the site directly.

# Limitations

## Browsers

We currently recommend the Chrome browser for the best experience. Users of Safari will notice that the positions of drawings, shapes, arrows, text, and sticky notes differ slightly from those of their colleagues. This is due to browser implementation differences that we're in the process of accommodating for. If you wish to use Safari, we recommend that your colleagues also use Safari so that the positions match up for everyone. Note that the styles palette on Safari is not visible but can still be clicked in the upper right corner of the screen.

If you notice issues on browsers other than Safari, [please let us know on GitHub](https://github.com/jupyterspot/support).

## Mobile

Related to the above, we recommend using JupyterSpot on the desktop as of now. On mobile browsers, the locations of drawings, shapes, arrows, text, and sticky notes will be very different from on the desktop, which may cause confusion about what notebook content a colleague is referring to. We've found found this issue with Safari on iOS and iPadOS, but if you find issues on other configurations [please help us catalogue them](https://github.com/jupyterspot/support).
